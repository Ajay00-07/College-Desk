Build a full-stack web application called College Desk (Engineering College Edition) using React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend) with PostgreSQL database.



System Overview:

College Desk is a Generative AI–powered workflow automation platform designed for engineering colleges to streamline attendance management, document creation, approvals, and compliance.



Key Features:

1. Role-Based Authentication

   - Admin, Faculty, and Student login.

   - Role-specific dashboards for task management and approval workflows.



2. Attendance Management

   - Direct, real-time integration with iONCudos for attendance data.

   - Automatically marks students as present if HOD/Faculty approval is granted, even if the class teacher marked them absent.

   - Identifies students below attendance thresholds.

   

3. Generative AI Document Creation

   - AI automatically generates:

     • Attendance shortage reports

     • Condonation request letters

     • Monthly attendance summaries

   - Output format: downloadable PDF/Word.

   - AI chat assistant allows users to generate or summarize reports on demand.

   - Sample AI assistant prompts:

     • Students: “Can I take leave for 3 days medical?” or “I have 68% attendance, can I write exams?”

     • Faculty: “Can I condone attendance below 65%?” or “What is the project approval workflow?”

     • Admin: “Generate attendance condonation approval letter for HOD” or “Draft circular for exam rescheduling.”



4. Approval Workflow Automation

   - Documents routed: Faculty → HOD → Principal.

   - Digital Approve/Reject with audit trail.

   - Real-time notifications for pending, approved, or rejected tasks.

   - Task Tracker showing status of each request.



5. Secure Record Storage

   - Encrypted storage of all generated documents, approvals, and audit logs.

   - Admin analytics and historical access.



6. Compliance & Rule-Based Assistance

   - AI Compliance Assistant trained on academic handbooks, attendance policies, examination rules, leave regulations, project approvals, and departmental workflows.

   - Responds with rule citations and compliance suggestions.

   - Generates official letters and documents with fields: Applicant Name, Department, Dates, Approval Authority, Compliance Status.

   - Example: “Generate formal approval letter for student Priya Singh (ECE Dept) requesting condonation for 5% attendance shortage due to medical leave from 12–15 Sept, including reference to Attendance Rule 4.2.”



7. Tech Stack

   - Frontend: React

   - Backend: Node.js/Express

   - Database: PostgreSQL

   - AI Model: OpenAI GPT API

   - Authentication: JWT

   - Styling: Tailwind CSS

   - Deployment: Docker / Cloud



8. Security

   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

   - Encrypted document storage

   - Full audit logging for transparency



9. Expected Outcomes

   - 80% reduction in time spent preparing attendance documents

   - Error-free, standardized reports

   - Faster digital approvals and transparent tracking

   - Smart AI assistance for students, faculty, and admin

   - Direct attendance updates in iONCudos with approval
